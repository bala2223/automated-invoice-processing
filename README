# ðŸ§¾ Automated Serverless Invoice Processing System (AWS)

This project demonstrates a fully serverless application on AWS to automatically process invoice images, extract text using Textract, and notify users via email.

- **AWS Lambda** â€“ Run code serverlessly
- **Amazon Textract** â€“ Extract text from image
- **Amazon DynamoDB** â€“ Store extracted data
- **Amazon SNS** â€“ Send email notification
- **CloudWatch** â€“ Monitor and debug logs

2. S3 triggers Lambda function
3. Lambda:
   - Uses Textract to read invoice
   - Saves data to DynamoDB
   - Sends email via SNS
4. Logs appear in CloudWatch
